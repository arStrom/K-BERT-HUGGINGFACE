Some weights of ErnieRCNNForMultiLabelSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at ./models/ernie3 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'lstm.weight_ih_l1_reverse', 'lstm.weight_hh_l0_reverse', 'lstm.bias_hh_l0_reverse', 'lstm.weight_ih_l0_reverse', 'lstm.weight_ih_l1', 'lstm.weight_hh_l1', 'classifier.weight', 'lstm.weight_hh_l0', 'lstm.bias_hh_l1_reverse', 'lstm.bias_ih_l0_reverse', 'lstm.bias_ih_l1', 'lstm.weight_ih_l0', 'lstm.bias_hh_l0', 'lstm.weight_hh_l1_reverse', 'lstm.bias_hh_l1', 'lstm.bias_ih_l0', 'lstm.bias_ih_l1_reverse']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
