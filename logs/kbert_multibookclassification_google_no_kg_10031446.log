[BertClassifier] use visible_matrix: True
Some weights of the model checkpoint at ./models/google were not used when initializing BertForMultiLabelSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'bert.pooler.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'bert.pooler.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForMultiLabelSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForMultiLabelSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForMultiLabelSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at ./models/google and are newly initialized: ['output_layer_1.bias', 'output_layer_1.weight', 'output_layer_2.weight', 'output_layer_2.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
2 GPUs are available. Let's use them.
