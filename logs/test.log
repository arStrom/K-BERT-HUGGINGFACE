Some weights of the model checkpoint at ./models/ernie1 were not used when initializing ErnieRCNNForMultiLabelSequenceClassification: ['ernie.pooler.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'ernie.pooler.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing ErnieRCNNForMultiLabelSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing ErnieRCNNForMultiLabelSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of ErnieRCNNForMultiLabelSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at ./models/ernie1 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'lstm.weight_ih_l1_reverse', 'lstm.weight_ih_l0', 'lstm.bias_hh_l1', 'lstm.weight_hh_l1', 'lstm.bias_ih_l0', 'output_layer_1.bias', 'lstm.weight_hh_l0_reverse', 'lstm.bias_ih_l1', 'classifier.weight', 'lstm.bias_ih_l1_reverse', 'lstm.bias_hh_l1_reverse', 'lstm.bias_hh_l0_reverse', 'lstm.weight_ih_l1', 'lstm.bias_hh_l0', 'lstm.weight_hh_l1_reverse', 'lstm.bias_ih_l0_reverse', 'lstm.weight_hh_l0', 'output_layer_1.weight', 'lstm.weight_ih_l0_reverse']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
